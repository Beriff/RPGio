<h1>RPGIO</h1><br>
RPGIO is a powerful discord bot base for building an RPG game. RPGIO relies on random generation to provide users a wide range of weapons/monsters/skills/effects, etc.<br>

RPGIO can run as is, just paste the right token inside `bot.py` but it supports .json extensions. You may directly change the source code in downloaded folder or in your fork at github.

<h1>Features</h1>
It is planned for RPGIO to support clans, levels, fights, weapons, skills, effects, armor, ore (smelting and tinkering), economy, levels, multiplayer.
